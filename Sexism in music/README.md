Throughout the centuries music has taken place in almost everyoneâ€™s life, while studies have shown that music can have a big
influence on our everyday behaviour and ideologies. This paper analyzes this influence by focusing on sexist content in
contemporary music. Using cross-domain classification sentiment analysis a model
was created trained on identifying sexist tweets and applied to song lyrics. The results of this model was then tested on a different lyric dataset and tested for accuracy.
