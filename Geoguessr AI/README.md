This is an AI created for the game Geoguessr AI.
 
Geoguessr is a game that uses google street view. The player gets dropped in a completely random position on google street view
The goal is to guess on a map where you think you are. The player who gets the closest wins. 

Humans have gotten so good at this that they can locate themselves even with the slightest bit of information. 
(Like a patch of grass, the numberplate of cars or electricity poles.) The goal is to make an AI that can match the best players in the world. 

The project is currently under construction.
