# Portfolio

This repository contains a variety of different Portfolio projects. Some originate from the CodeAcadamy career path: Data Scientist: Machine Learning. Other projects are in collaboration with other students, originating from my studies in Artificial Intelligence. And some are some personal projects, of which I took an interest in. Each folder is appropriately labeled. For the best overview of my skills I recommend checking the x folder. This contains a combination of all previously mentioned projects.
