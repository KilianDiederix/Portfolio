# Portfolio

This repository contains a variety of different Portfolio projects. Some originate from the CodeAcadamy career path: Data Scientist: Machine Learning, a career path with over 50 lessons ranging from basic python tests to advanced Machine Learning and Deep Learning, including Statistical analysis, SQL and more. Other projects are in collaboration with other students, originating from my studies in Artificial Intelligence. And some are some personal projects, of which I took an interest in. Each folder is appropriately labeled. For the best overview of my skills I recommend checking the x folder. This contains a combination of all previously mentioned projects.

Also some testing projects. :)
